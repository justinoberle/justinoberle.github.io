                <p class="italic">
                    We offer completely off the grid, automated, watering and monitoring systems for outdoor gardens and indoor plants. You plant it, harvest the garden, and the system does everything in between. No need to constantly worry about your gardens health.

                    How it works
                </div>
                <p class="italic">
                    We deploy sensors that collect soil moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and sunlight. We then create a health management system which is completely automated. Everything is solar powered and all of the water comes from rain collection if applicable, making this 100% off the grid. We then offer an application where you can monitor your garden in real time from anywhere in the world.
